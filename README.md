Analyze the performance implications of mobile image processing implementations.
Fancy image transformations -- colloquially, “filters” -- have dramatically captured the attention of the mobile market, to the point that operating systems and devices take special measures to promote efficient image processing. This project assignment is intended for us to learn about system bottlenecks to image processing and tricks to optimize performance.
